# JamuJamu

If you’re using iPad Mini, It is recommended to run the app vertically on your iPad so that all the image assets are visible. The text should be visible on any model. It would also work just fine horizontally or vertically on other models. Lastly, make sure the iOS has been updated to iOS 15.0. Enjoy! :D

Before you start, in case you want to navigate through the story with the ability to undo your choice, you can change the settings by :
 1. Go to StoryView.view
 2. Go to line 125 and you'll see the instruction to delete line 125-128.
 3. After you make your first choice on the app another "back" button will show up below the first one. The first button will take you back to the menu, while the one below will undo your choice.
